You will find a detailed description of our business area in this PowerPoint. Please request access if you don't have it yet. 30 White #e20074 Our Mission Telemetry and Connectivity Our mission is to be the nerve center of Software-Defined Vehicles, enabling them to perceive, connect, and communicate with the world around them. 60 White #e20074 Our Vision We imagine a world where all vehicles are defined by software to be secure, connected, entertaining, sustainable, automated and user centric. White #e20074 Our Commitment We focus on breaking silos and building foundations for our partners to have access to all type of vehicle data and creating insights into hidden SDV secrets for scaling, performance optimization and achieving excellence. White #e20074 Our Objective We accelerate to bridge the communication gap between vehicles, external systems, and infrastructure, extract data on real time for actionable insights, transform, transmit and analyze data to accelerate SDV trends such as AD. The graphic demonstrates a system for vehicle telemetry and connectivity. It shows how data from vehicles is collected by onboard components, transferred through a network to a central monitoring center, and analyzed for diagnostics, performance, and behavior. This data is then processed and stored in a semantic layer (data lake) and can be accessed by third-party applications through a secure backend platform. The system enables remote control and diagnostics, real-time analytics, and integration with other services: For more Information contact us... 35% 65% Florian Prehn Software Defined Vehicle Business Service Owner ðŸ“© florian.prehn@t-systems.com More Information on...

    "    You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating the quality of Confluence page content to ensure it is optimized for use with a chatbot. The following recommendations outline the criteria for high-quality content that is effective for chatbot responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Quality Guidelines for Confluence Content:\n",
    "    1. Content Structure: Ensure the text is clear and well-structured to allow the chatbot to understand and extract information accurately.\n",
    "    2. Simplicity: Use simple language and avoid complex sentences. Provide necessary details without unnecessary complexity.\n",
    "    3. Context: Avoid short bullet points that lack context. Use meaningful, coherent sentences that provide complete information.\n",
    "    4. Consistency: Avoid undefined abbreviations and acronyms that can confuse the chatbot. Use consistent terminology throughout the content.\n",
    "    5. Headers: Use headers and sub-headers to include page titles in the context, which helps the chatbot understand the structure better.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Image Handling:\n",
    "    6. Prioritize Text: Whenever possible, prioritize text over images. Images should be used to complement text, not replace it.\n",
    "    7. Text Descriptions: Provide text descriptions for each image to ensure the chatbot can interpret visual information accurately.\n",
    "    8. Quality: Use high-resolution images to facilitate accurate OCR.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Attachments (PDFs, PPTs, World, Excel):\n",
    "    9. Prioritize Text: Prioritize text over attachments whenever possible. If attachments are essential, it is crucial to Provide concise summaries of key points from attachments, including descriptive titles and relevant keywords.\n",
    "    10. Selectable Text: Use PDFs with selectable, searchable text to ensure compatibility with the chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Overall Recommendations:\n",
    "    12. Text Over Attachments (crucial): Prioritize textual content over attachments. If attachments are essential, it is crucial to Provide concise summaries of key points from attachments, including descriptive titles and relevant keywords.\n",
    "    13. FAQs and Scenarios (optional, not considered in the overall grade when it's absent but considered as a plus when available): When relevant, incorporate FAQs and common scenarios related to the topic when possible.\n",
    "    14. Tagging and Categorization: Tag attachments (PDF, PPT, word, excel, images) with relevant keywords and categorize them appropriately.\n",
    "    15. Summaries (optional, not considered in the overall grade when it's absent but considered as a plus when available):  Consider including a brief summary or abstract at the beginning of long or complex documents. This allows the chatbot to quickly grasp the main points. However, summaries may not be necessary for concise, well-structured documents or those utilizing tables effectively to organize information.\n",

    "    - If images are used within a table structure along with relevant text descriptions, consider them appropriately described.\n",
    "    - If the document is short, concise, and well-structured, it may not require a separate summary.\n",
